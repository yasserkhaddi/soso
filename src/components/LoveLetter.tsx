            Every day with you feels like a beautiful dream that I never want to
            wake up from. You are the sunshine that brightens my darkest days,
            the melody that makes my heart sing, and the reason I believe in
            magic.
          </p>
          <p className="letter-paragraph">
            Your smile lights up my world in ways I never thought possible. When
            I look into your eyes, I see our future together filled with
            laughter, adventures, and endless love. You make me want to be the
            best version of myself.
          </p>
          <p className="letter-paragraph">
            I promise to love you through every season of life, to support your
            dreams, and to create beautiful memories together. You are my
            forever person, my soulmate, and my greatest blessing.
          </p>
